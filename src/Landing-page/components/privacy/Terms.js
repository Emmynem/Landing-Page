       <h3>7. Miscellaneous</h3>
       <p className='terms-p'>
       These General Terms and Conditions may be amended or replaced by Passcoder from time to time as described herein or by written agreement at the discretion of Passcoder. Charges and payment terms may be changed in accordance with the terms of your Price Schedule; all other provisions set out in the General Terms and Conditions may be amended in Passcoder‘s sole discretion and effective immediately upon notice to you, if applicable, or if any changes are made to this Subscription Agreement, such changes will:
Only be applied prospectively; and 
Not be specifically directed against Members, you or your Authorised Users but will apply to all similarly situated Passcoder customers using the Online Services. This Subscription Agreement may not be supplemented, modified or otherwise revised by any Authorised Users or Members in the absence of a signed writing duly executed by Authorised representatives of both parties. Furthermore, this Subscription Agreement may not be supplemented, modified or otherwise revised by Authorised Users or Members by Email exchange even if the Email contains a printed name or signature line bearing signature-like font. Any terms and conditions proposed by you which are in addition to or which conflict with the General Terms and Conditions are expressly rejected by Passcoder gmbh and shall have no force or effect. The foregoing does not prohibit the execution of electronic contracts bearing electronic signatures of Authorised representatives of both parties, provided such signatures include digital certifications or are otherwise authenticated.
Upon the breach of this Subscription Agreement by an Authorised User or Member, Passcoder may temporarily suspend or discontinue providing access to the Online Services to the breaching party without notice, in addition to pursuing any other legal remedies available to Passcoder.
All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing or displayed electronically in the Online Services by Passcoder. Notices shall be deemed to have been properly given on the date deposited in the mail, if mailed; on the date first made available, if displayed in the Online Services; or on the date received, if delivered in any other manner.
The failure of an Authorised User, Member, Passcoder, or any third party supplier of Materials to exercise or enforce any provision hereof shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of any such right or provision of the right to enforce it at a later time.
Passcoder‘s ability to provide Materials is regulated by a variety of privacy, data protection, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions (“Data Laws”) and by the licenses under which it obtains Materials (“Licenses”). You acknowledge that Passcoder will perform a due diligence review of your account upon registration and that the due diligence review will be heightened if you desire to access sensitive, nonpublic Materials about individuals. You also acknowledge that Passcoder will perform periodic reviews of you and your Authorised Users‘ use of Materials subject to Data Laws or Licenses (“Regulated Data”) in order to comply with Data Laws and license restrictions, and that the review may include asking you or your Authorised Users to verify that use of Regulated Data was for a permissible purpose. You and your Authorised Users will cooperate fully with Passcoder in any such due diligence or regulatory review and will promptly produce all relevant records and documentation reasonably requested by Passcoder. All reviews will be at Passcoder‘s expense. If there is any failure to cooperate fully with Passcoder, or if any review reveals the lack of a permissible purpose to access Regulated Data, Passcoder may deny access to the Online Services or to Regulated Data. Passcoder will be under no obligation to reduce the fees payable by you to the extent that it is unable to provide Regulated Data to you based solely on your non-cooperation.
If you, any of your Authorised Users, Members, or any person you or your Authorised Users permit to use the Online Services or who gains access through an Authorised User‘s or Member‘s failure to properly secure his or her Passcoder login credentials or computer (a “User”) should access or use Regulated Data in an unauthorised manner (a “Security Event”), then the following provisions will apply: 
If required by applicable law, you will notify the individuals whose information has potentially been accessed or used that a Security Event has occurred;
You will notify any other parties (including but not limited to regulatory entities and credit reporting agencies) as may be required by law;
The notification will not reference Passcoder or the product through which the Regulated Data was provided, nor will Passcoder be otherwise identified or referenced in connection with the Security Event, without the express prior written consent of Passcoder;
You will be solely liable for all claims that may arise from a Security Event caused by you, Members, your Authorised Users or a User and you will indemnify Passcoder in full for any third party claims directed against Passcoder that arise from the Security Event; and
All notifications and indemnity claims related to the Security Event will be solely at your expense.
This Subscription Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If any provision of this Subscription Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, then 
(a) such provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent.
 (b) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Subscription Agreement.
Where applicable, each affiliated company of Passcoder and each third party supplier of Materials has the right to assert and enforce the provisions of this Subscription Agreement directly on its own behalf as a third party beneficiary.
This Subscription Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes any prior written or verbal communications, representations, proposals or quotations on that subject matter.
